## ‚õì Design architect

Build the demo by CLEAN + MVVM architect using SwiftUI with Combine

### ü•á CLEAN + MVVM

Why?
There are many different architect patterns in Software Engineering. In mobile software, the most popular used are MVVM and Clean Architect

It will help to divide project into 3 main layers

#### ‚ùå Domain layer

It is the independent layer, the most inside of the onion which includes the business logic of the app:

- Contains `Entities`, `UseCases`.
- Each use case will do a single business logic.
It is totally independent and can be reused by other projects.
- Fetches data from Repository through repository protocol.
- `Endpoints` specific REST API endpoints.
- Domain layer doesn't know any thing about outer layers(UI, Data).

#### ‚ùå Data layer

- It contains `Repository` or data stores to store data locally.
- It uses repository design pattern. A design pattern that provides abstraction of data.
- It's responsible for getting data from data source from local database or from API.
- `Domain` layer doesn't know where the data come from. just tell the repository that it needs data and the repo decides where to fetch them.
- It depends on `Domain` layer.

#### ‚ùå Presentation layer

- Contains UI of our application and also `ViewModel`.
- `View` passive and doesn't contain any business logic inside. It's responsibility is to display UI elements.
- `ViewModel` are responsible for executing one or many use cases.
- `ViewModel` keep the state of the `View` by having `Published` properties and binding them to the data it receives from use cases.
- `Router` responsible for navigation.
- It depends on `Domain` layer.

The main purpose of applying software architect in development that will help to easier maintenance the project, add new feature and didn't break other feature, the most important thing: our code is testable.

The example project has **90%** test coverage, that's so good.

### ü•à SwiftUI

As Apple, SwiftUI is a modern way to declare user interfaces for any Apple platform. Create beautiful, dynamic apps faster than ever before.
We can preview the code instantly. It will compiled the UI ‚Äî visible, and editable at all times. Previews can also display your UI in any device and any orientation.

### ü•â Combine

It's a new framework provides a declarative Swift API for processing values over time. Now we can replace RxSwift, ReactiveSwift with Combine.

It‚Äôs a powerful framework to dynamically respond to value changes over time.
